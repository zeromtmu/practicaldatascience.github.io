    "#  Q Learning!\n",
    "______________________\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q Learning is a type of unsupervised reinforcement learning technique.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning is a class of machine learning algorithms in which the the program determines the ideal behavior within a specific context based on reward feedback for a transition from a given state to another.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we learn how to find an optimal path from one node of a graph to another using Q-learning. But before we get into that, here is a little motivation and theoretical introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Humans vs. Deep Q-networks \n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning algorithms were used in Google's DeepMind to develop the so called \"deep Q-networks\".Using only pixel data and the game score as inputs, this algorithm learned 49 Atari 2600 games and proved to be as succesful as expert humans. A paper about the same was published in Nature in February 2015.(linked here : http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html - look at the videos linked on the website!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Decision Process\n",
    "More specifically, Q-learning is used to find an optimal action selection policy for a given finite Markov Decision Process(MDP).We shall now see what is a Markov Decision Process. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Decision Process model contains: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set of world states S \n",
    "2. Set of possible actions A\n",
    "3. A real valued reward function R(s,a) where $s \\in S$ $a \\in A $\n",
    "4. A description T of each action's effects in each state\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision process satisfies the **Markov Property** which means that the effects of the action taken in a state depend on that state only, and not any prior state or action in the process. An MDP is a _\"discrete time stochastic control process\"_ which means that we specify a probability distribution to the all the states reachable from a given state by performing a specific action. More precisely, T: S X A -> Prob(S), which represents the distribution P(s' | s, a) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy $\\pi$\n",
    "A policy $\\pi$ is a mapping from S to A, which means that it is choice of action given a state. The algorithms objective is to make this policy such that cumulative rewards of the process (all successive steps) is maximized. Q-learning has been proven to find such an optimal policy eventually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following a policy is what you think it means: given a state s select and execute an action $\\pi(s)$, and repeat for the new state reached by executing $\\pi(s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Which policy is the best policy?__\n",
    "\n",
    "We can evalute a policy by finding the expected value of the total reward. To compare different policies with infinite expected values we use an objective function (reward function, which is essentially a negative loss function) that maps an infinte sequence of rewards to a single real value.We can create this function by discounting to favour \"earlier\" rewards. More formally, for a given discount rate __$0<\\gamma<1$__, we discount a reward which is n actions away by $\\gamma^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that an infinite sum $$\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}r*\\gamma^i = r*\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$$ from the infinite sum of a geometric series. Such an approach is most widely used and, as you can see, analytically tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value funtion\n",
    "Before we proceed our analysis, we define a value funtion (objective function) $V_{\\pi}:S->\\Re$ that gives us the expected objective value by following the policy $\\pi$ for each state $s \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus this value function maps every policy to a real \"utility\" value, with which we can order the policies, atleast partially. The functions are partially ordered because some policies can result in the same real value. This model ensures that ATLEAST one optimal policy exists: the one with the maximum expected reward. Also notice that every optimal policy will have the same value function, say V*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can mathematically define the value function as:\n",
    "$$V_{\\pi}(s) = R(s,\\pi(s)) + \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,\\pi(s),s') . \\gamma . V_{\\pi}(s')$$\n",
    "where $\\pi(s)$ represents an action 'a' to be performed for a given state s dictated by the policy $\\pi$, s' are all the states reachable from s with probability described by $T(s,\\pi(s),s') = P(s' | s, a) $. And so the optimal policy from the state s is just :\n",
    "$$V^*(s) = max[\\ \\forall a \\in A\\ (\\ R(s,a) + \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') . \\gamma . V^*_{\\pi}(s')\\ )\\ ]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, there is only one V* for every s in S.\n",
    "These equations are known as Bellman Equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "The Q-learning algorithm is just an iterative value updation form of the value function($Q:S X A -> \\Re$):\n",
    "$$Q'(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \\alpha * (\\ R(s,a) + \\gamma . max Q(s',a) - Q(s,a)\\ )$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha(s,a)$ is the learning rate and is between 0,1, which could be the same for every pair of (s,a).Here, we must define an \"episode\" of the algorithm which ends when s' represents the final state.Just like before, we wish to find the optimal action for each state, which is done by maximizing the cumulative reward from that state. Note that $Q(s_f,a)$ where $s_f$ is the final state is never updated and corresponds to fixed reward r. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will be simplified and further explained in the example prose below.\n",

    "# Sample Problem\n",
    "In this tutorial I will illustrate how this algorithm, i.e, finding an optimal action selection policy for a finite MDP, works to find the best path from a one vertex in a graph to another. To solidy the problem more, consider a building with 5 rooms, with some doors that connect the rooms, while some of the them open up to the outside of the building. Our goal in this problem is to find a way out of the building, given we are placed in a given room. Specifically, consider this set up:\n",
    "![alt text](files/building_pic.gif)\n",
    "Clearly, this can be represented as a graph with each room as a vertex and a door as a bi-directional edge. And so our problem is to find a graph path to the goal state, which is represented by vertex 5 in the following graph repsentation of the building:\n",
    "![alt text](files/graph1.gif)\n",
    "Now, notice that world of states, S, is the set of vertices, which represent the rooms.\n",
    "The set of possible actions, A, is represented by the outgoing edges from a vertex, which correspond to travelling from one room to another through the door connecting the two. \n",
    "And so, next, we must assign a Reward function R(s,a). We set R(s,a) = 100 for all those actions which take s to the goal state = 5, and 0 otherwise. These rewards become the edge weights, as represented by the following graph:\n",
    "![alt text](files/graph2.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reward/Environment Matrix\n",
    "Notice that a graph of this sort can be represented by a 5x5 reward matrix in which the row index, i, represents the current state, column index, j, the final state by going through the door connecting the room i to the room j, and the value at (i,j) the reward. Since we knew all the states a priori, we can initialize this 5x5 matrix, but even we didnt know all the states, we can just program the code to add another column when it discovers a new state.This type of code is capable of handling a large amount of unkown states and probably is more data driven. We represent the impossible actions(non-existent edges), like going directly from room 2 to 4, by 'None' values in the matrix.\n"

    "Next, we define the Q-matrix, that will hold the reward value at postion (i,j) for the corresponding action as calculated by our algorithm. Every iteration of the Q-learning algorithm is referred to as an 'episode' which begins with selecting a random state and ends the moment our 'graph seach' or traversal of the DFS reaches the goal state. In simpler terms, our algorithm is is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplified Q-Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the gamma parameter, and environment rewards in matrix R.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize matrix Q to zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Do While the goal state hasn't been reached:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A. Select one among all possible actions for the current state.\n",
    "        B. Using this possible action, consider going to the next state.\n",
    "        C. Get maximum Q value for this next state based on all possible actions.\n",
    "        D. Compute: Q(state, action) = R(state, action) + Gamma * Max[Q(next state, all actions)]\n",

    "    End Do\n",
    "\n",
    "   End For\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus this Q-matrix will represent the policy $\\pi$ that we must follow to get to the goal state from any given state. After sufficient experience, i.e enough episodes, our algorithm will result in a Q-matrix with converged and stabalized values, such that any more learning would not change the Q-matrix. This proof is not covered in this tutorial. "
