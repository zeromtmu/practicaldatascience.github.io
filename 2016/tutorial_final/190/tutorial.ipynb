    "# Big Data Analytics with Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework. Originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley's AMPLab, the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, which has maintained it since. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault-tolerance.(From wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you to install Spark and run some classic big data programs based on Spark. We will re-implement some functions that we already implemented in former homework based on Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that Spark will store data in the memory, and if the test data is too big, some problems may happen. So, the test dataset is only 100 lines, but it will be pretty easy to scale-up.\n",
