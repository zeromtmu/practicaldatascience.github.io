    "# Introduction to LDA\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn about the text-mining aspect of an algorithm called Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA for short. We have already spent a decent amount of time learning about text mining in this class, so I won't go over those basics now, but have a look at this wikipedia page if you would like a refresher: [Text Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining \"link to wikipedia page\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation was developed by David Blei, Andrew Ng, and Michael I. Jordan, and was published in their 2003 paper about topic discovery called [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/blei03a.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "As per the wikipedia definition: \n",
    ">Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word's creation is attributable to one of the document's topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"k-means.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "In other words, LDA attempts to guess the topic of a document based on the words that are contained within that document and based on other documents within the same corpus that have similar words. \n",
    "\n",
    "LDA can be thought of as a type of clustering algorithm, where each observation is classified as one of a number of classifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In K-Means, all observations are classified into mutually exclusive groups, as shown in the picture to the right. LDA differs from K-means in this respect however, because each observation (word) will be assigned to a topic using a continuous scale, so each word can (and often does) belong to many different topics. This ensures that certain documents share topics with other documents within the same corpus (which is to be expected. If you pass in all of Shakespeare's works into a topic model, you would expect to see recurring themes throughout his work). \n",
    "\n",
    "### LDA \n",
    "The LDA model can be described using the plate notation picture shown below:\n",
    "<img src=\"LDA plate.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "In this diagram, \n",
    "* ${D}$ represents the number of documents (in the example below, Tweets)\n",
    "* ${N}$ represents the number of words in a document\n",
    "* ${K}$ represents the number of topics\n",
    "* ${\\eta}$ represents the topic hyperparameter\n",
    "* ${\\alpha}$ represents a parameter of the Dirichlet distribution\n",
    "* ${\\beta}$ represents the distribution of topics\n",
    "* ${\\theta}$ represents the vector of topic proportions within a document ${d}$ within ${D}$\n",
    "* ${Z}$ represents the distribution of topics for a given word ${n}$ in a document ${d}$\n",
    "* ${W}$ represents a word found within a document ${d}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the same names in the code below. To begin, before we have trained the model, all we have is the last parameter ${W}$, or the words within documents. LDA infers the topic \"structure\" and distribution based on the frequency and co-occurance of words within and between documents. All variables besides ${W}$, ${\\alpha}$, and ${\\eta}$ are latent, meaning that they are inferred based on the data that the model is given (${i.e.}$ the words and the documents that those words are found in). \n",
    "\n",
    ">The generative process is as follows. Documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. LDA assumes the following generative process for a corpus ${D}$ consisting of ${D}$ documents each of length ${N}$\n",
    "1. Choose ${\\theta_i \\sim Dirichlet(\\alpha)}$ where ${i \\in \\{1 \\dotsc D\\}}$\n",
    "2. Choose ${\\eta_k \\sim Dirichlet(\\beta)}$ where ${k \\in \\{1 \\dotsc K\\}}$\n",
    "3. For each word position ${i,j}$\n",
    "   * choose a topic ${z_i,_j \\sim Multinomial(\\theta_i)}$\n",
    "   * choose a word ${w_i,_j \\sim Multinomial(\\eta_i,_j)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other parameters, ${\\alpha}$ and ${\\eta}$ can be manually manipulated:\n",
    "* ${\\alpha}$< 1 makes fewer topics, ${\\alpha}$ > 1 more topics per doc\n",
    "* ${\\eta}$< 1 less similarity within topic, ${\\eta}$ > 1 more similarity within topic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational Bayes\n",
    "Learning the distributions ${\\beta}$ and ${\\theta}$ is a Bayesian inference problem. \n",
    "Learning the various distributions (the set of topics, their associated word probabilities, the topic of each word, and the particular topic mixture of each document) is a problem of Bayesian inference. There are several options for Bayesian inference, including Gibbs Sampling, and Expectation Propogation. In this implementation we'll use Variational Bayes to iteratively estimate the posterior distribution. Variational Bayes is used in this circumstance as a means to approximate the posterior probability of the unobserved topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's get started\n",
    "I have pulled a little more than 300 tweets that contain \"#debates\" (using the Twitter API and tweepy), which is what I'll be using to demonstrate LDA. You can do the same if you like. Simply go to [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/), request API keys, and off you go. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a topic model using LDA, we'll need to first start by cleaning the data. Much of the code you see below is from the text_classification homework. I have created a function below called clean_up, which will take in my data (one row (tweet) at a time), and clean it up:\n",
    "1. Convert all the text to lower-case, remove \"'s\" from all the words (it's to it; this helps to identify stop words, and generally makes better features), get rid of punctuation, etc.\n",
    "2. Tokenize the words - each word will be considered independently (in context) within the topic model\n",
    "3. Lemmatize the words - remove conjugations and other variations of words to get words to their infinitive form - makes for better features\n",
    "4. Stem the words using Porter Stemmer. This will reduce the words down to their roots, which makes the features a little hard to understand sometimes, but groups similar tokens to make for better features\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the code below, you may need to install a couple of packages:\n",
    "* ```pip install lda```\n",
    "* ```pip install pyldavis```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Refine the Results \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can tell from the terms that compose our clusters, we have some more cleaning up to do. Words like \"http\" and \"rt\" shouldn't have made it this far in the analysis, but it is easy to see in LDAvis that we should remove them to get a clearer picture of the topics and topic distributions. Additionally, I'm going to remove spanish words using the nltk list of stopwords, since the majority of the tweets are in english, and all of the spanish words are getting grouped together. I'm going to remove any terms that have a number in them, since most of the features that contain numbers are part a url that has been broken into pieces instead of useful features. Last but not least, there is clustering of clusters here, which may mean there are naturally fewer topics than I have specified for the model to find, so I'll reduce that number and check the results empirically.
