    "# Introduction To Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you a hig-level neural networks library(Keras), written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It's userful for researchers to go from idea to result with the least possible delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some fancy features of Keras:\n",
    "> - Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through total **modularity, minimalism, and extensibility**)\n",
    "- Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of two\n",
    "- Supports arbitrary connectivity schemes \n",
    "- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through these Keras features with more details:\n",
    "- **Modularity**. A model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone, fully-configurable modules that can be plugged together with as little restrictions as possible. In particular, neural layers, cost functions, optimizers, initialization schemes, activation functions, regularization schemes are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models.\n",
    "- **Minimalism**. Each module should be kept short and simple. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. No black magic: it hurts iteration speed and ability to innovate.\n",
    "- **Easy extensibility**. New modules are dead simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making Keras suitable for advanced research.\n",
    "- **Work with Python**. No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is compatible with **Python 2.7-3.5**.\n"
